# portfolio-persona
 My final project on HTML/CSS IN DEPTH. I was instructed to create a portfolio persona from a variety of business. I chose to create for Maganta & Gallo. An imaginary company based in Austin, TX that sold jewelries for special occasions.

# What to expect..
There are no functionalities, no Javascript, just plain HTML/CSS.
No media queries, it's made for desktop screen and above.

# v1
This is the first version. I'll update it subsequently.
